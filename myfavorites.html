            One of the gifts a Kdrama addict can give another is the title of a <br>
            wonderful show they have not yet discovered. Here are some of my</br>
            few recommendations and appreciations of Korean dramas
            from the<br> distant past to the recent past, all of shows that I consider
            worthy of</br> being called "great." - Monisha</br>
